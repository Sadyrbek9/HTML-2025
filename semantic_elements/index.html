                    The early history of Kyrgyzstan is defined by its geographic location, which is far from the great centers of ancient civilization. The first written records of a civilization in the area of Kyrgyzstan are dated to the 2nd century BC. The earliest written history of the Kyrgyz people is recorded in Chinese sources dating to the 6th century AD. The Yenisei Kirghiz lived in the upper Yenisey River valley, central Siberia. In Late Antiquity the Yenisei Kirghiz were a part of the Tiele people. Later, in the Early Middle Ages, the Yenisei Kirghiz were a part of the confederation of the Göktürk Khaganate. The Kirghiz Khaganate was a Turkic state, established by the Oghuz Turks in 840. At its height, the Khaganate would cover large parts of Central Asia and Iran.</p>

                        The Khaganate was divided into the Western and Eastern Khaganates. The Western Khaganate, with its capital at Suyab, was conquered by the Tang Dynasty in 657, and the Eastern Khaganate was subsequently conquered by the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, who were then replaced by the Kyrgyz. The Kyrgyz Khaganate was a regional power in Central Asia for several centuries, before it was overrun by the Mongols in the 13th century. The remnants of the Khaganate were divided into the Chagatai Khanate and the Yarkand Khanate, which were two independent states under the Mongols. In the 17th century, the Kyrgyz came under the control of the Khanate of Kokand, which was a Muslim state that ruled over the Fergana Valley in eastern Uzbekistan, southern Kyrgyzstan, and western Tajikistan. The Khanate of Kokand was conquered by the Russian Empire in the 19th century, and the Kyrgyz people were incorporated into the Russian Empire as part of the Kyrgyz Oblast. The Kyrgyz Oblast was then transformed into the Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast in 1920, and in 1926 it became the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet

                    The Kyrgyz people were conquered by the Russian Empire in the 19th century. The Russian conquest of the Kyrgyz people was part of the Great Game, which was a geopolitical competition between the Russian Empire and the British Empire for control of Central Asia. The Russian Empire conquered the Khanate of Kokand in 1876, and the Kyrgyz people were incorporated into the Russian Empire as part of the Kyrgyz Oblast. The Kyrgyz Oblast was then transformed into the Kyrgyz Autonomous Oblast in 1920, and in 1926 it became the Kirghiz Autonomous Soviet
